Type definitions for [lib-jitsi-meet](https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet) (incomplete and created manually).

I was looking for type definitions package for lib-jitsi-meet, but it wasn't found.<br>
(Same thing is being discussed in [original repo's issue](https://github.com/jitsi/lib-jitsi-meet/issues/1025).)

I created it manually for my uses.<br>
This includes some main type definitions picked by API documents and original sources.

**This type definitions is incomplete and may have many mistakes.**<br>
Be careful if using this.<br>
Any PR is welcome.
